"""Lane S — the solver arena. The v4 flagship: a standing world-record bounty.

Miners publish an OPEN-SOURCE solver (source + a container pinned by digest) and
get paid only by provably BEATING the reigning champion on a fresh hidden batch
of diverse instances, under competition conditions, on the eval host's standard
hardware. Every scored result carries its certificate (a SAT witness re-checked
against the CNF, or a DRAT proof re-checked by drat-trim); a TIMEOUT is the eval
host's own observation, never a miner claim.

This extends `solver_docker` (Lane B, attested single-solve) into the full
solver-commit mechanism the design calls for:

  * SOLVER REGISTRY — (source_url, container_digest, source_sha256). Dedup on
    source hash (a copy of the champion can never beat the champion — it dedups
    to the same commitment), one-eval-per-commitment (a hotkey can't farm weight
    by re-submitting an already-evaluated solver).
  * EVAL BATCH RUNNER — run a solver over N seeded instances under the eval
    host's containment (scaffold.lanes.sandbox: network-isolated, rlimit-bounded;
    salvaged from the monolith's oracle jail). Collect per-instance
    (outcome, wall_ms, certificate) and VERIFY EVERY CERTIFICATE before crediting.
  * CHAMPION STATE MACHINE — current champion, challenger evaluation, a STRICT
    dominance margin (a challenger must beat the champion's PAR-2 by at least
    DETHRONE_MARGIN_MS to take the crown), and a record-fall EVENT that the money
    layer consumes (jackpot to the new champion + burn steps down one notch).
  * SCORING — PAR-2 (penalized average runtime, the production v6 metric) plus a
    MARGINAL-VBS bonus (extra weight for instances ONLY your solver closes that
    the champion could not). Built ON TOP of grading.py via the lane's score();
    grading.py is NOT forked.

Sybil property (must hold in every lane): k identities submitting the SAME solver
all dedup to one source-hash commitment -> one evaluation, one merit. k copies of
the champion -> zero marginal merit. Enforced by the registry, asserted in
rc_verify.
