"""Full-provenance audit for the two-mode validator.

Wraps the ``cathedral`` package (installed via the ``provenance`` extra) to:

  * fetch the signed evidence index, epoch manifest, and content-addressed
    artifacts from the public evidence surface;
  * independently verify the policy registry, the signed score-class report,
    and every referenced assurance receipt;
  * deterministically recompute the pre-burn weight vector under the pinned
    versioned reward mechanism; and
  * compare the recomputation against Cathedral's signed vector.

Anti-equivocation state lives in the validator's state file: a report that
re-signs the same source epoch with different contents, or moves the source
epoch backwards, fails the audit outright.

If the ``cathedral`` package is not installed the audit reports NOT_PROVEN
(shadow mode warns loudly; authority mode refuses to submit).
