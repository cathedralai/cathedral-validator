"""The thin v4 validator — the WHOLE validator, ~200 lines.

    fetch signed scores from the orchestrator
    -> verify Ed25519 signature against the pinned key
    -> sanity-check (finite, nonnegative, fresh, right subnet, no rollback)
    -> apply burn FROM THE SAME SIGNED PAYLOAD
    -> map hotkeys to uids against the live metagraph
    -> set weights

No local row database. No backfill. No rolling window. No score buckets.
Every scoring decision (recency, multi-lane composition, burn) lives
orchestrator-side and changes WITHOUT a validator release; this binary only
enforces that what it applies is exactly what the pinned key signed.

Run:  python -m scaffold.validator_thin --publisher-url https://api.cathedral.computer \
          --public-key-hex <pinned hex> [--once] [--broadcast]

Dry-run by default (computes + prints the uid vector, does not submit).
Rollback fence state persists in a small JSON file (--state-file), so a
publisher cannot re-serve an older policy_version after a restart.
