"""Three-outcome grading — SHARED logic, built once, used by every lane.

Outcomes: SAT (witness self-verifies), UNSAT (proof cert checks), TIMEOUT
(neither closed in time), INVALID (malformed). This is where the
cost-minimizing attestation policy lives:

    SAT and UNSAT SELF-VERIFY (a witness / a DRAT cert is cheap to check),
    so they need NO attestation. Only a TIMEOUT claim is unfalsifiable
    locally — "I ran the solver to the limit and it didn't close" — so a
    TIMEOUT is the ONLY outcome that an attested run vouches for.

A lane decides the Outcome + raw_metric in verify; this turns that into a
bounded, speed-aware score. Keeping it here means no lane re-implements the
speed curve or the attest policy.
