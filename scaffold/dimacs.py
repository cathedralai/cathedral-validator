    Deterministic in `seed` (Rule: no unseeded randomness). The planted model

    method='biased' (default, tier1): draw a clause and flip one literal
    whenever the model fails it.  This biases clause polarities toward the
    planted model, making any-size instance easy for heuristic solvers.
    Kept as the default so tier1 is byte-identical to the pre-AJM board.

    method='ajm' (tier2): Achlioptas–Jia–Moore "two hidden assignments"
    (SAT 2005).  Each clause is drawn at random and KEPT only if the planted
    model satisfies it with exactly 1 or 2 true literals (reject all-false=0
    which breaks the planted model, and all-true=3 which breaks its bitwise
    complement).  Because kept-clause distribution is symmetric under flipping
    every sign there is NO literal-frequency bias for a solver to exploit,
    making instances genuinely hard near the phase transition (m/n ≈ 4.26).
