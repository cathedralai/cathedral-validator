"""Tests for the artifact-tier score refresh + preview-compose orchestrator.

Covers the missing "scored -> weights" wiring: refresh runs only enabled artifact
mechanisms, tolerates a not-yet-merged adapter (skips + logs, never errors), persists
an empty vector as "contributes nothing", and the compose path inherits set_weights'
mainnet/SN39 refusal so it can never write real weights.

Also pins the ordering the CyberGym closed-epoch gate depends on: an adapter that
raises is skipped *before* put_scores, so a refusal preserves the last published
vector instead of overwriting it with an empty one.
