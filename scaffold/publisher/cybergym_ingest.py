"""CyberGym producer-to-publisher score transport.

The CyberGym validator (the producer) derives verified per-miner scores on its
own host. Nothing previously carried them into the publisher's database, so the
``cybergym_scores`` table the mechanism adapter reads could never be populated
in production: there was no endpoint, no migration, and no wire contract. This
module is that missing transport.

It is deliberately a faithful copy of the authentication and epoch-fence shape
``external_scores.py`` already uses for producer-posted score documents (see
``external_scores.store_report`` and the ``POST /v1/external-scores/violet``
handler in ``app.py``), with its own configuration keys so no existing route or
blend path changes:

  * source-scoped bearer credential, constant-time compared;
  * mandatory raw-body HMAC over the exact authenticated bytes, fail-closed
    (an unconfigured secret means 503, never "accept unsigned");
  * audience binding: the document must declare the network/netuid this
    publisher is configured for;
  * strictly increasing epochs per audience, byte-identical retries accepted
    idempotently, conflicting documents refused.

Exactly ONE producer per audience
---------------------------------
``CATHEDRAL_CYBERGYM_PRODUCER_HOTKEY`` is REQUIRED, and the epoch fence is
audience-scoped rather than producer-scoped. Those two facts belong together: the
adapter composes the single newest complete report for an audience, so admitting a
second signer would let it outbid the real producer simply by posting a higher
epoch. One configured signer plus one audience fence removes that entirely.

The cost is deliberate and worth stating: rotating the producer key does NOT reset
the epoch counter. A replacement key must continue above the highest epoch already
stored for that audience, or its first post is refused with ``epoch_too_old``.

Wire contract
-------------
``POST /v1/cybergym/scores``

Headers:
  * ``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` (or ``X-Cathedral-Cybergym-Token``)
  * ``X-Cathedral-Cybergym-Signature: sha256=<hex>``, HMAC-SHA256 over the
    exact request body bytes.

Body (exactly these keys; extra or missing keys are rejected)::

    {
      "producer_hotkey": "<ss58 identity of the producing validator>",
      "network": "<must equal the configured weight-policy network>",
      "netuid": <must equal the configured weight-policy netuid>,
      "source_epoch": <int >= 0, the producer's own epoch counter>,
      "generated_at": "<ISO-8601 UTC, the authenticated freshness clock>",
      "complete": true,
      "score_units": "<canonical unit label for the score values>",
      "scores": {"<miner_hotkey>": <nonneg finite number>, ...},
      "evidence_sha256": "<64 hex chars, producer evidence bundle digest>"
    }

``complete`` must be ``true``: a CyberGym report is the full truth at its epoch,
so an omitted miner scores zero (revoked) rather than keeping an older value.
That is the posture ``external_scores.COMPLETE_REQUIRED_SOURCES`` already takes
for attested sources. An empty ``scores`` object is therefore meaningful and
legal: "nobody scored this epoch", which makes the mechanism non-contributing so
its share burns.

``generated_at`` is the ONLY freshness clock. The adapter derives
``ScoreVectorMeta.signed_at_ms`` from it, never from read time, so a stale
document can never look freshly signed. It is bounded in BOTH directions: a
timestamp later than receipt time plus
``CATHEDRAL_CYBERGYM_MAX_FUTURE_SKEW_SECS`` (default 120s, matching
``external_scores.max_report_future_secs``) is refused, because a future-dated
report would compute a negative age downstream and stay inside every freshness
window for as long as it sat in the table.

Failure modes: 404 (ingest disabled, the default), 503 (bearer, HMAC secret,
producer, or audience not configured), 401 (bad bearer or bad HMAC), 403 (a
document declaring a signer other than the configured producer), 400 (malformed
body, wrong audience, non-complete report, future-dated report), 409 (epoch
rollback, or a conflicting document at a stored epoch), 413 (body over the cap,
enforced before parsing AND before buffering).

Mounting: ``build_app`` mounts this router and injects the publisher's own
``Store`` through ``app.dependency_overrides``, so the endpoint EXISTS on a
full-role process and configuration alone turns it on. That is the point of
mounting it: an intake nobody can reach is a component, not a default-off
endpoint. The default-off gate stays at the route, so an unconfigured deployment
answers 404 and mounting changes nothing for it. The path is deliberately not in
app.py's narrow service-role allowlists, so read, submit, and worker roles keep
refusing it.

Another integrator can still mount it standalone::

    from scaffold.publisher import cybergym_ingest
    cybergym_ingest.set_publisher_store(store)
    app.include_router(cybergym_ingest.router)

Guardrails: default OFF, no chain calls, no secrets in code or logs, body size
capped before any JSON parsing and before buffering, writes only the two 0048
tables.
