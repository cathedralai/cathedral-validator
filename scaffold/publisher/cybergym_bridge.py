"""CyberGym lane composition: MechanismSpec in, burn-safe allocation out.

This is the join between the ingested CyberGym reports and the ONE composed
weight vector. It is deliberately the whole lane in one place and nothing more:

  * build the CyberGym ``MechanismSpec`` (default DISABLED at fraction 0.0);
  * read the lane's score vector through
    ``mechanism_cybergym_adapter.cybergym_score_snapshot`` (one newest fresh
    complete report, freshness from the authenticated ``generated_at``);
  * compose through ``mechanism_eligibility.compose_eligible``, the sanctioned
    entry point that makes the registered-uid gate impossible to skip, with
    ``preserve_forfeited=True`` so an unproven share is never reallocated;
  * allocate the forfeited share to the burn IDENTITY, never to another miner and
    never to another lane.

Two properties make that last bullet real rather than aspirational:

  * The spec carries ``requires_forfeit_preservation=True``, so
    ``mechanism_router.compose`` RAISES ``ForfeitPreservationRequired`` if anyone
    ever composes this mechanism through the legacy renormalizing path. There is
    no silent fallback to reallocation, and this module is the single entry point
    that satisfies the requirement.
  * The burn destination is resolved from the configured burn HOTKEY through the
    same fresh ``metagraph_hotkeys`` snapshot the eligibility gate uses, with the
    UID-to-hotkey binding verified in both directions. A bare numeric UID is
    never trusted, and the pre-existing env default of UID 204 is deliberately
    not consulted, because UIDs are recycled when miners deregister and a guessed
    UID is how a forfeited share ends up in a miner's wallet. Unresolvable means
    refuse, see ``resolve_burn_destination``.

Default off, twice over: ``CATHEDRAL_CYBERGYM_MECHANISM_ENABLED`` is unset and
``CATHEDRAL_CYBERGYM_WEIGHT_FRACTION`` is 0.0, so merging this module changes no
live weight vector. Nothing in the publisher calls it yet: the live signed vector
is still built by ``weights.build_signed_vector`` from ``compose_scores`` alone.
When an owner does wire it in, it must run BEFORE the Ed25519 signature in
``weights.build_signed_vector`` so the forfeited share is inside the signed
payload rather than applied after it.

Safety posture:
  * Read-only. This module writes no table and calls no weight writer. The sole
    chain writer remains ``scaffold.validator_thin.set_weights_on_chain``.
  * Fail closed. Any condition that makes the CyberGym share unprovable, or that
    leaves the burn destination unresolved, yields an EMPTY allocation so the
    caller keeps its V1 vector. Paying nobody beats paying the wrong uid.
  * Deterministic. No randomness; the only clock input is the freshness
    comparison against the authenticated report timestamp.

    A persisted spec is VALIDATED, not trusted. The admin route that writes the
