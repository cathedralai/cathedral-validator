"""SAT mechanism adapter — plugs V2 SAT solves into the mechanism router.

Turns the EXISTING verified V2 SAT scores (scaffold.publisher.v2_pipeline
.score_totals, which already sums verified per-miner solves in the V2 store)
into a router ScoreVector keyed by miner UID, per
deploy/MECHANISM_ROUTER_CONTRACT.md. This is the first "artifact"-tier
mechanism (proof-backed, not a signed claim) meant to plug into the router.

hotkey -> uid mapping comes from the ``metagraph_hotkeys`` table — the same
out-of-band snapshot table scaffold/publisher/weights.py already reads for
its payable-hotkeys policy (see weights._load_fresh_metagraph_hotkeys and the
NETWORK_ENV/NETUID_ENV settings). Hotkeys with no row (or a NULL uid) in that
table are dropped, not zeroed.

Guardrails:
  - Read-only: does not write to any table, does not import/modify
    v2_pipeline.py or weights.py's write paths.
  - Default off: nothing in the publisher calls this yet; it has no effect
    on any live weight vector until a MechanismSpec wires it into the router.
  - Deterministic: no randomness; the only time dependency is
    ScoreVectorMeta.signed_at_ms, which records when the vector was built
    (not used in the score math itself).
  - No secrets: reads two env vars for network/netuid (same ones weights.py
    already uses), no keys or credentials touched.
