"""Signed final-scores vector — the orchestrator's ONE number per miner.

This is the v4 scoring interface. The orchestrator composes whatever scoring
it wants (multiple challenge types, recency, arena payouts) into a single
per-hotkey weight, signs the vector, and serves it at
``GET /v1/validator/weights/next``. A validator's whole job is: verify the
signature, sanity-check, apply burn from the same signed payload, set weights.
No row pulling, no local averaging, no 7-day window — every scoring decision
lives HERE and can change without a validator release.

Wire shape is byte-compatible with the vector deployed validators already
verify (cathedral.policy.signing.SignedWeightVector): canonical bytes = drop
``signature``, sort keys, no whitespace, UTF-8; Ed25519 over that. Env knob
names match the live publisher so config carries over on the domain swap.

Score composition (the recency gate lives here, not in validator code):
  * window: only solves in the trailing CATHEDRAL_WEIGHTS_WINDOW_HOURS count
    (default 24h). A miner who stops solving drops out of the vector when the
    window passes — this replaces the validator-side 7-day mean whose frozen
    tail let idle miners coast for a week.
  * mode `flat_recent`: every hotkey with >=1 accepted solve in the
    window gets equal weight — byte-faithful to today's economics (flat 1.0
    rows) minus the stale tail.
  * mode `proportional` (default): weight = distinct challenges solved in the window,
    multiplied by explicit tier importance weights, relative to the busiest
    solver. The dial to turn when we want harder or more important tiers to
    pay more — flipped by env, no validator involvement.
  * mode `row_score_recent` (default-off): weight = sum of positive
    eval_runs.row_json weighted_score values in the window, relative to the
    top scorer. This is the explicit mode that makes attested row score
    upgrades observable in the active signed vector.

    IDENTITY-AWARE SCORING (the Sybil fix). When coldkey collapse is enabled AND
