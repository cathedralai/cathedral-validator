"""Validator weight-feed health thresholds (single source of truth).

Pure, dependency-free threshold logic shared by:

  - the read-only ``/v1/admin/validator-health`` endpoint (scaffold.publisher.app)
  - the standalone release gate (scripts/validator_release_gate.py)

Keeping the numbers here means the live health surface and the pre-deploy gate
can never silently disagree on what "fresh" means. Values come straight from
``deploy/RELIABILITY_UPGRADE_PLAN.md`` (Vector Freshness Thresholds + Phase 7).

All thresholds are seconds. The chain constants (tempo) are verified against
finney: SN39 tempo = 360 blocks = 72 min @ 12 s/block.
