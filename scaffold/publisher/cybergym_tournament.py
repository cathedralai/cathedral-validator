"""Top-5 rank-tournament scoring for the CyberGym lane.

VENDORED (verbatim, pure/stdlib-only) from cathedral_distill.cybergym_tournament @ a470b59.
The publisher stays free of the default-OFF `cathedral_distill` integration dep
(the adapter's "duplicate rather than depend" stance), so this is a byte-faithful
copy: keep it in lockstep with distill; `tests/.../test_cybergym_tournament_vendored.py`
pins the mechanism constants so drift is caught.

The mechanism (see ``CYBERGYM_DISPATCH_SCORING_DESIGN``):

1. **Per-epoch, base 100.** Each miner's epoch score is *absolute* difficulty-weighted
   completion: ``100 × solved_units / dispatched_units`` over the epoch's common batch.
   Solving everything = 100; half the weighted set = 50. It means the same every epoch.
2. **Rolling total, 5-epoch recency window.** ``T = 0.03·a + 0.07·b + 0.15·c + 0.25·d +
   0.50·e`` over the last five epochs (``e`` latest; weights sum to 1). Missing older
   epochs count as 0, so a newcomer's only epoch is the latest (weight 0.50) and can
   reach the top-5 in a few epochs.
3. **Top-5 rank tournament.** Miners are ranked by ``T`` (ties broken deterministically);
   the top five earn fixed shares of the CyberGym lane — ``0.65, 0.14, 0.10, 0.07, 0.04``.

Because the payout is by *rank* with a hard top-5 cutoff, a tiny scoring disagreement
becomes a whole payout slot — so this is only consensus-safe if every validator derives
the **identical** ranking. Everything here is therefore a pure, fixed-precision function
of the disclosed, verified solve set, with a canonical tie-break, so all validators
produce byte-identical standings. ``build_scoreboard`` returns the announced, signable
document.
