"""Bounded retention for high-volume publisher ledgers.

Default-off. This exists to stop Postgres volume growth after the operator has
grown the volume enough for safe pruning. It keeps scoring semantics intact by
retaining more than the default 24h scoring window.

Two kinds of policy run in one tick:

* Row-level pruning (the original behaviour): whole rows in the high-volume
  ledgers are deleted once they age out of the scoring window.
* Body compaction (Phase 6 retention table): the only large *raw* payload the
  DB holds is ``per_miner_witnesses.dimacs_solution`` (the accepted DIMACS
  solution body). Per the plan that raw body is kept 1-7 days for accepted
  solves, while the answer/witness hashes (``dimacs_solution_sha256``,
  ``answer_hash``) are kept forever. Compaction blanks the raw body in place
  and never touches the hash columns or the row, so witnesses stay replayable
  by hash and scoring rows are untouched.

Phase 6 retention table mapping:

  | Data                          | Retention   | Where                        |
  | ----------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
  | Pending solution body         | until verified | (no pending body persisted) |
  | Rejected raw solution         | 1-24h       | rejected_raw_hours (no body today) |
  | Accepted raw solution         | 1-7d        | accepted_raw_hours -> witness body |
  | Answer / witness hash         | forever     | never deleted/compacted      |
  | Receipt metadata              | 30-90d      | pm_attempt_hours (hash-only) |
  | Aggregate scoring rows        | forever     | eval_runs feed retained      |

Every destructive step is gated: it only runs when retention is enabled AND
not in dry-run mode. Dry-run reports the row/body counts that *would* be
retired without changing anything.
